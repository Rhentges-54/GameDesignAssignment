# GameDesignAssignment
Assignment for Game Design class

# Overview
This assigment includes the basic controls and designs of a third-person platforming game in the Unity engine such as movement controls and a game over screen. To add soem more complexity to the project, I also created an obstacle that a player would need to avoid to avoid getting a death screen, a moving platform for players to jump onto and then reach a further platform, and a object that would give you an additonal completion note on the game over screen if collected. 

# Issues
Issues that have currenttly not been addressed yet are: Player spawning mid-air at the start of the game, Player having to hit the space bar twice to come back down after a jump, the moving platform moves further away than it is supoposed to before returning.
