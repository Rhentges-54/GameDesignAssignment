# GameDesignAssignment
Assignment for Game Design class

This assigment includes the basic controls and designs of a third-person platforming game such as movement controls and a game over screen. To add soem more complexity to the project, I also created an obstacle that a player would need to avoid to avoid getting a death screen, a moving platform for players to jump onto and then reach a further platform, and a object that would give you an additonal completion note on the game over screen if collected.
